# ChecksumSelection
A program that finds a sequence of bits in a 32-bit word such that the checksum for the input data concatenated with the received word matches the given result.

The program receives 2 lines as input:

- The first line contains eight characters - a record of the desired checksum in hexadecimal notation.

- The second line contains a sequence of characters, including numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, for which you want to calculate the checksum.
